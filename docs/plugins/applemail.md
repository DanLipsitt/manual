## Apple Mail Plugin

This plugin lets you browse your mailboxes and messages contained in Apple
Mail.

Just call up Mail.app in the first pane and hit â†’ or /. It will reveal all
mailboxes and folders for each account. Arrowing into a mailbox reveals all
messages in that folder. The selected message can be viewed with Quick Look or
"opened" to reveal it in Mail.

This plugin also allows actions for composing messages or sending messages
directly (via the E-mail Support plugin) to funciton based on settings in
Apple Mail.
