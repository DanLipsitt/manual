# Calculator Plugin

## What is it?

This plugin provides a built-in calculator for Quicksilver

## Overview

The Calculator plugin allows you to calculate mathematical expressions entered
into Quicksilver with the 'Calculate' action. To calculate expressions you can
run the 'Calculate' action on a text string, or put Quicksilver into 'Math'
mode by typing '='.

### Entering Expressions

Expressions are entered using the same syntax as Spotlight, for example:

  * =(sin(30))^2
  * =e^4 + sqrt(50)

### Displaying Results

Results from the 'Calculate' action can be displayed in one of 3 ways, and/or
copied to the clipboard. See 'Calculator' preferences.

### Calculator Mode

In the Calculator preferences you can also choose what calculator engine you
wish to use. Currently only [`bc`](x-man-page://bc) and [`dc`](x-man-
page://dc) are provided.

Go to the [Calculator Preferences pane](qs://preferences#CalculatorPrefPane)
for more information and options on displaying results.
