## OmniWeb Module

This plug-in allows you to add your Bookmarks, Favorites and History from
OmniWeb into Quicksilver's catalog. It also provides a proxy object and access
to web searches.

### Proxy Object

If proxy objects are enabled, you can access the URL of the page currently
open in OmniWeb by searching for "Current Web Page". Several browsers provide
a Current Web Page proxy object, so look for the one with OmniWeb's icon.

### Web Searches

Searches defined in OmniWeb's Shortcut Preferences can be added to the catalog
automatically and used from within Quicksilver. For example, if you define a
shortcut with a keyword of `google@`, you can do either of the following from
within Quicksilver:

  1. google → Search For… → [search terms]
  2. [search terms] → Find With… → google

This functionality requires the Web Search Module for Quicksilver.
