## Services Menu Plugin

This plugin scans all the available services for your installed applications
and adds them as actions. You can view the available actions by going to the
Quicksilver [Preferences](qs://preferences#QSSettingsPanePlaceholder),
clicking 'Actions' on the right hand side then filtering 'by Plugin' for the
'Services Menu' plugin.

This plugin can potentially add hundreds of new actions, which may affect the
ranking of your preferred actions. If this occurs, re-rank your actions by
dragging them up or down in the Actions preference pane.
